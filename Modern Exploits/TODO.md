# Modern Exploits TODO

This section hasn't been planned yet, but will likely cover turning a CVE into an exploit, kernel exploits, etc.  This is the last section that will be written and planned--please look at the other sections first.

We'll also cover more advanced mitigations here--shadow stacks, guarding control flow, etc.
